'''Below, we have provided a list of tuples that consist of student names, final exam scores, and whether or not they will pass the class. For some students, the tuple does not have a third element because it is unknown whether or not they will pass. Currently, the for loop does not work. Add a try/except clause so the code runs without an error - if there is no third element in the tuple, no changes should be made to the dictionary.'''
